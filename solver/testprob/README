This directory contains few benchmark SDP instances provided in SDPA sparse format.

Both 'control10' and 'theta5' instances are taken from SDPLIB set. 

Instances 'test2-200' and 'test17poly-200' are newly generated and come from 
polynimial optimization. These are saved in a STANDARD SDPA sparse format. 

We also added here instances 'test2-200r' and 'test17poly-200r', which are 
the same problems as 'test2-200' and 'test17poly-200', but saved in a MODIFIED
SDPA sparse format. The reason for this is that these 2 problems have rank-one
structures in their constrain matrices, which PCSDP can exploit.  

IMPORTANT! In order to solve problem 'test2-200r' the parameter 'rank1' in param.pcsdp
file should be set to '2', i.e., 'rank1=2'. In the case of 'test17poly-200r' the user
should use 'rank1=1'. For the rest of the problems in this directory 'rank1=0', should
be used (this is the default mode).
